# WP AI Admin

> **Commercial Beta source of truth:** `main` = WP AI Admin 2.1.14 + Cloud Core 0.3.6. Older installable artifacts are retained only when they are still useful for rollback/compatibility; historical development remains available through Git history.

## 2.1.14 — Native consent callback navigation

After the actual site's administrator selects allow or deny, commit a no-store HTML handoff with automatic meta navigation and a manual continuation link to the fixed central callback. Native 2.1.13 retained a POST/303 chain blocked by its self-only CSP when returning from another domain. Preserve strict CSP, no-referrer, nonce, HTTPS, administrator checks, one-use code exchange, credentials and identities. Core remains 0.3.6. New Chromium regression loads the real authorize() handler from the exact native 2.1.13 release and the candidate.


## 2.1.14 / Cloud Core 0.3.6 — Central gateway and many-site onboarding

The native MCP block now explains its site access toggle and shows https://wpaiadmin.ru/mcp as the primary ChatGPT endpoint. Local MCP and native OAuth discovery remain in collapsed diagnostics. Native 2.1.14 goes on every site; Core 0.3.6 goes only on wpaiadmin.ru.

Core 0.3.5 form-action self could block form redirects to another site's consent page and the ChatGPT OAuth callback in Chromium. Core 0.3.6 commits a no-store handoff document with automatic meta navigation and a manual continuation link to the already validated target; the strict self-only form policy, nonce, PKCE, owner binding and exact callback checks remain intact.

The central cabinet displays one account plan/shared quota and all connected sites, plus an optional connection check. Registration, OAuth consent and access-token site capacity now consistently allow up to 50 registrations per account across every plan. Adding a site still requires new client consent; sites are never silently added to an existing grant. Paid-plan assignment is an account-level capability; payment processing and automatic purchase activation remain a separate unfinished billing stage.

See [Connection Contract 1.2](docs/CHATGPT-CONNECTION-CONTRACT.md). Chromium reproduction and candidate checks run against actual Surface.php with fixture WordPress/session/back-channel behavior; actual production account authorization remains a separate acceptance gate.

## Connection compatibility baseline

The preserved onboarding and ChatGPT authorization flow is defined in [Connection Contract 1.2](docs/CHATGPT-CONNECTION-CONTRACT.md), with repository working rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Supported baseline: native 2.1.14 on each site, central Cloud Core 0.3.6 on wpaiadmin.ru, public MCP https://wpaiadmin.ru/mcp. Register sites through browser administrator consent, then separately authorize the ChatGPT client for explicitly selected sites.

Commercial beta baseline was consolidated into `main` on 2026-10-07: native WP AI Admin 2.1.14, Cloud Core 0.3.6, central MCP `https://wpaiadmin.ru/mcp`. Live central ChatGPT authorization and reads against both `wpaiadmin.ru` and `okean.market` have been confirmed. The remaining live release gate is a real mutation → verify → receipt/proof → rollback → rollback verification cycle through the central gateway. Future connection-affecting changes must follow the contract's compatibility, migration and regression process.

## 2.1.12 — Restore administrator dashboard navigation

The main WP AI Admin entry now opens the existing management dashboard. The parent menu, explicit first dashboard submenu and connections submenu are registered together in that order. This fixes 2.1.11 registering the child before the parent, which replaced the main link and generated a bare /wp-admin/oai-gateway-connections path.

The dashboard includes automatic site connection and connection management links; the connections page has a return button. All MCP, AI Lifecycle, Test Automation, operation history, sandbox and approval controls remain on the dashboard. Credentials, OAuth, identities and browser pairing are preserved; Cloud Core 0.3.5 does not need replacing.

Real WordPress regression validation renders actual menu HTML and both page callbacks and checks token/identity retention. The same test reproduces the failure with the exact previous 2.1.11 archive before verifying the update.

## 2.1.11 — Browser site connection

Install this native plugin on every connected WordPress site. Install Cloud Core 0.3.5 only on the central wpaiadmin.ru gateway. Both wpaiadmin.ru and okean.market need native 2.1.11 for automatic onboarding.

1. Open https://wpaiadmin.ru/wpai-cloud/connect in your approved beta account.
2. Enter the canonical HTTPS address of your WordPress site and click «Подключить автоматически».
3. Log in as an administrator on that site and click «Подключить сайт». The screen identifies the central account receiving access.
4. Return to the central cabinet automatically; the site is registered. Repeat for another site.
5. In your AI client connect to https://wpaiadmin.ru/mcp and authorize only the desired sites through the central OAuth consent screen.

No PowerShell, application password or manual token copying is required. A one-use authorization code is bound to the initiating central account, site and S256 verifier. The browser carries only code/state; the gateway exchanges them directly over HTTPS for an independent per-connection credential. The site stores its hash and the gateway seals the credential with the existing vault. An outstanding request lasts ten minutes and a consent code lasts two minutes. Paired credentials remain valid until revoked or the administrator loses their role; revoke from WP AI Admin → «Подключения к gateway» on the connected site.

Existing manual MCP tokens, native OAuth registrations and installation identities are preserved. All sandbox, approval, verification, license and rollback checks remain in effect; approval does not enable AI Lifecycle Control or Test Automation. Normal build-change permission reset remains active. Catalog stays at 116 tools, inheriting all 2.1.9 Woodmart and earlier fixes.

Reconnect of an active central registration updates its credential without duplicating the site. A revoked registration receives a new registration ID so old AI consent cannot regain access. An already registered site cannot be silently transferred to another central account.

Automated validation includes a two-site fixture and real WordPress REST/Options/MCP integration in CI. Live installation and real ChatGPT/Qwen authorization must be verified after installing both release packages. Billing and general-public enrollment remain outside this approved-user beta.

## 2.1.10 — MCP enable and disable

Administrator-only nonce-protected MCP toggle. Enabling preserves OAuth/manual credentials and identities; disabling stops automated modes. This fix is included in 2.1.11 alongside the 2.1.9 OAuth connection fix.

## 2.1.9 — Woodmart Base Settings Adapter

- Four MCP tools expose adapter status, bounded settings lists, one setting and sandbox updates.
- Requires Woodmart and WoodMart MCP 1.0.1. Updates only the base layer; active preset values and base values are shown separately.
- Uses native field sanitizers and device encoding before approval, and the native MCP update callback during Apply.
- Locks transactional InnoDB option storage, checks the entire settings option, preset conditions, theme identity and field schema, verifies persistence and invalidates generated CSS.
- Rollback restores exact raw field storage or inherited absence; unrelated newer changes block Apply and Rollback.
- Credentials, custom code and editor writes are excluded. Headers, layouts and general native write dispatch are not included.
- CI covers actual public WoodMart MCP 1.0.1 with a minimal theme API fixture in real WordPress; the licensed theme and its visual output require installation-site validation.
- Retains 2.1.8 Yoast map-order and 2.1.6 upgrade bootstrap fixes.

## 2.1.5 — Option Normalization Before Approval

- Capture WordPress `sanitize_option` output before creating the approved diff, preventing false verification failures when Yoast drops legacy fields.
- Reject non-idempotent sanitizers and baselines that cannot be restored exactly through WordPress before creating an operation.
- Preserve strict authoritative verification and stale-target/rollback conflict guards; never infer the expected snapshot from a live post-write read.
- Installed 2.1.4 operation 1689 exposed this issue; supported-baseline restore 1692 and corrected apply 1693 both verified successfully.
- Existing 2.1.4 Elementor and 2.1.3 integer stock/price policies remain unchanged.

## 2.1.3 — Disable State Sanitization

- When AI Lifecycle Control is switched off manually, owner and client-binding metadata are cleared.
- When Test Automation is switched off manually, session ID, client binding, page/product allowlists, session-created IDs and action counter are cleared.
- The generic `wp-ai-admin-tests/` file prefix is restored on disable.
- Production defaults remain human-approval-only with direct live writes disabled.
- All 2.1.2 Commercial Beta UI and upgrade-session guards are preserved.

## 2.1.2 — Upgrade Session Guard

- Fix the 25-row operation-history self-test contract.
- On the first wp-admin request after a build change, force AI Lifecycle Control and Test Automation into human-approval-only state.
- Clear stale test session IDs, client bindings, page/product allowlists and site-specific test paths on build change.
- Prevent a stale/replayed enable form POST from re-enabling AI Lifecycle or Test Automation during that same first post-upgrade request.
- Preserve OAuth registration, site identity and installation identity across normal plugin updates.
- Commercial Beta UI from 2.1.1 remains: one Disconnect action, 25 operation rows per page, draft/private test-page selector.

## 2.1.1 — Commercial Beta UI & Session Hardening

- Connected OAuth clients are no longer listed individually in wp-admin; the Connection card exposes one Disconnect action.
- Disconnect revokes all active OAuth tokens and disables AI Lifecycle Control/Test Automation.
- Full operation history is paginated at 25 rows per page.
- Test Automation uses a multi-select list of draft/private test pages instead of exposing a raw ID field by default.
- AI Lifecycle Control and Test Automation now explicitly clear stale enabled state when the plugin build changes.
- Production safety defaults remain unchanged: direct live writes OFF and human approval ON.

## 2.1.0 — Commercial Beta Candidate

WP AI Admin 2.1.0 freezes the validated 2.0.78 runtime baseline and switches the project into commercial-beta hardening.

- 111 MCP tools remain the canonical catalog.
- Direct live writes remain disabled.
- Human approval remains the default lifecycle.
- AI Lifecycle Control and Test Automation are explicit administrator opt-ins and are build/client-bound.
- Test Automation defaults are generic; no Okean-specific post/product IDs or test paths are shipped.
- Elementor container/page-layout mutators are centrally classified as write tools.
- OAuth/site/installation identity is preserved across normal plugin upgrades.
- Control Plane signed-entitlement verification exists as a foundation; remote enforcement is not required for the local beta.
- Commercial release gates and known beta limitations are documented in `COMMERCIAL-BETA-CANDIDATE.md`.

Validated pre-candidate baseline (2.0.78): 71/71 self-tests, 220/220 security fuzz, 109 PASS / 0 FAIL / 2 intentional SKIP / 0 BLOCKED extended matrix, plus three consecutive 16/16 mutation runs with baseline restored.



## 2.0.38 — Self-Test + Security/Control Plane foundation
- Product name updated to WP AI Admin.
- system.tool_catalog exposes the canonical expected MCP tool IDs and catalog hash.
- system.self_test performs safe read-only runtime/identity/database/catalog/integration checks without mutations.
- system.security_status exposes installation identity and the Control Plane security contract without exposing secrets.
- system.manifest schema v2 includes expected tool IDs for client-vs-server export audits.
- batch.plan rejects unknown tools and distinguishes read-only vs human-approved child operations.
- Control Plane contract reserves short-lived signed tokens, site/workspace binding, replay protection, revocation and freeze controls. Remote cryptographic enforcement is not claimed until a Control Plane is configured.

## 2.0.39 — Audit fixes
- Map `wp.read_content` post_type/per_page/page to REST type/limit/page and return pagination metadata.
- Reject absolute file paths and enforce canonical scope checks for new files and recursive searches; skip symlinks in listings.
- Guard REST rejection with the same human context as approval/apply/rollback.
- Make `system.self_test` probe the human approval guard instead of reporting a constant PASS.
- Classify read items correctly in `batch.plan`.

## 2.0.40 — Content navigation
- `wp.file.outline` lists bounded file landmarks and line numbers; `file.read` accepts an optional bounded line range and expected SHA-256.
- Elementor widget reads support `view=outline` and `view=html_range` with a content hash. Existing full reads remain available.
- HTML inspector supports `mode=outline` and bounded selector output; fixed #id lookup.
- WooCommerce search supports pagination and field selection.
- Experimental `content_navigation` flag can be switched in wp-admin; disabling it leaves legacy full reads available.

## 2.0.41 — MCP Basic auth and WooCommerce REST pagination
- Administrator Application Password sessions now carry `mcp:read` and `mcp:write` scopes, matching the existing MCP Basic authentication policy. Sandbox and wp-admin human approval remain mandatory for writes.
- `/read/products` delegates requests with `page`, `fields`, `query`, or `sku` to the bounded WooCommerce search; old calls without these parameters retain their original response.

## 2.0.42 — Boolean projection fix
- `wp.read_post` now respects JSON boolean `false` for content, Elementor data and inline CSS. The self-test checks the omitted fields on an existing page when one is available.

## 2.0.43 — File rollback repair
- Use the WordPress Filesystem `delete()` method for file rollback and workspace restore, checking the result.
- Allow a human administrator to retry rollback after a failed attempt only when the operation was applied; the live-state conflict check still protects subsequent edits.
- Retain the 2.0.42 boolean projection fix; runtime validation is required after installation.

## 2.0.44 — Command read hardening
- `option get` uses the same secret redaction policy as the options API.
- `db query` only accepts `SELECT COUNT(*) [AS alias] FROM table` for approved WordPress tables; arbitrary SELECT is blocked.
- Reject command separators/metacharacters and unexpected positional arguments for read commands.
- Add read-only self-test probes for option redaction, command shape and database query scope.

## 2.0.45 — Sensitive reads and list pagination
- Redact known license and key-hash options, sensitive nested option fields, and command metadata values in `post get` and `cron event list`.
- Add `page`, `total`, `total_pages` and `has_more` for media, users and comments, with explicit MCP input schemas.
- Add read-only self-test checks for redaction and command projections.
- Reject negative product prices and a sale price above the regular price before sandbox creation.
- Revalidate WooCommerce payloads before apply, including operations created by older builds; redact theme mods and never return a truncated raw value sample.
- Gutenberg reads accept `view=outline` to return paths, attribute names, sizes and hashes without repeating large HTML and raw content. Legacy full reads remain available.


## 2.0.46 — Scoped Test Automation Mode
- Human approval remains the default. A WordPress administrator may temporarily enable Test Automation Mode for 15, 30, 60 or 120 minutes.
- The session is pinned to the current build, administrator, MCP client and a generated session ID; it automatically becomes inactive on expiry or build change.
- Only sandbox operations created through the same MCP client while the session is active are tagged for automated lifecycle actions. Existing pending operations are never adopted automatically.
- MCP `operation.approve`, `operation.apply`, `operation.reject` and `operation.rollback` remain blocked outside the active scoped test session. Inside it, the normal sandbox snapshot, expiry, conflict detection, Woo validation, double verification, proof/receipt and rollback guards still execute.
- Existing post/content and Elementor operations are eligible only for configured test post/page IDs or draft/private posts whose title contains TEST/ТЕСТ. WooCommerce operations require an explicit product allowlist.
- Automated file lifecycle is limited to `child_theme`/`theme` paths under `okean-core/wp-ai-admin-tests/`. Automated option writes are limited to `oai_test_*` and `wp_ai_admin_test_*`. Plugin/theme/user arbitrary write actions are not enabled.
- `system.test_automation_status` exposes the active session policy without secrets. `system.security_status` reports whether the temporary exception is active.
- The wp-admin dashboard adds enable/disable controls, TTL, fixture allowlists and a visible warning while automation is active. Turning it off immediately restores the original human-only lifecycle behavior.
- Added read-only self-test contract checks for the automation boundary.

## 2.0.47 — Sequential Regression Runner
- Added `system.regression_run`, available only inside an active scoped Test Automation session. It executes one lifecycle scenario at a time and stops immediately if cleanup cannot be proven.
- Regression scenarios cover content, WooCommerce stock normalization, Elementor HTML widgets, scoped test files, optional Gutenberg fixtures and a reject-only guard. Each live mutation follows sandbox → approve → apply → verify → proof/receipt → rollback → rollback verify before the next scenario starts.
- WooCommerce sandbox snapshots now predict the stock-status transition caused by a stock quantity change, and Apply accepts only runtime differences that are valid consequences of the explicitly requested Woo fields.
- Verification uses `applied_data` when WooCommerce normalized the runtime snapshot, so later Verify/rollback checks compare against the state that was actually persisted.
- File sandbox writes may create missing intermediate directories only after the full path passes the scoped no-traversal/no-symlink write resolver. This enables `okean-core/wp-ai-admin-tests/` fixtures without weakening ordinary file scopes.
- `system.test_automation_status` exposes the last compact regression result. The normal human-approval model remains the default and the runner is unavailable when Test Automation Mode is inactive.


## 2.0.48 — Extended Regression Suite
- Added a managed Gutenberg draft fixture that is created when Test Automation Mode is enabled, auto-allowlisted for the session, and removed when the administrator disables the mode.
- Added explicit `gutenberg.get_outline` so compact Gutenberg reads are visible as a first-class MCP tool even on clients that do not refresh optional schema properties reliably.
- Extended `system.regression_run` with Elementor settings and Elementor draft-create lifecycle scenarios; supported preview types are checked while the operation is still pending.
- Added `system.regression_matrix`, which combines bounded read checks, pagination/redaction/command guards, file/Elementor/Gutenberg/Woo reads, schema/export checks, sequential reversible mutation runs, preview/proof/receipt checks and a per-tool `PASS/FAIL/SKIP/BLOCKED` matrix.
- The matrix reuses the same scoped Test Automation session and normal sandbox lifecycle; it cannot run when Test Automation is inactive and still stops mutation sequencing if cleanup cannot be proven.
- Expected MCP catalog with Content Navigation enabled: 71 tools.

## 2.0.49 — Created-object rollback verification repair
- Fixed `elementor_page_create` rollback verification: permanent absence of the AI-created page is now the expected successful rollback state instead of a false `404` failure.
- Rollback deletion verification uses both WordPress object lookup and a direct posts-table existence check after cache cleanup (`dual_absence`) so stale cache cannot hide a surviving page or misreport successful cleanup.
- Retrying rollback for an already-deleted AI-created Elementor draft is idempotent: expected absence is accepted and the operation can complete verification instead of being blocked as a post-apply conflict.
- External verification of `rolled_back` / `rollback_failed` operations now evaluates the rollback target state by default rather than incorrectly re-checking the former applied state.
- Corrected cache refresh for `elementor_page_create` to use the created preview page ID rather than parsing the `elementor_page:<id>` target prefix as a numeric post ID.
- Managed Gutenberg fixtures now store real newline separators in newly created test sessions.
- Successful regression scenarios expose `cleanup_effective=true` and the cleanup verification source when available.
- Added read-only self-test checks for created-page rollback absence semantics and managed Gutenberg fixture newline construction.
- Expected MCP catalog remains 71 tools with Content Navigation enabled.



## 2.0.50 — Persistent QA history, coverage and safe fuzzing
- Added `system.regression_history`: bounded persisted history of the last 50 regression/fuzz runs without raw content or secrets.
- Added `system.coverage_report`: accumulated per-tool and per-stage PASS/FAIL/SKIP/BLOCKED counters.
- Added `system.security_fuzz`: negative-only, no-live-write checks for file traversal/scope, command metacharacters, DB grammar, Woo validation, option redaction and localhost SSRF.
- Regression runner/matrix now record compact history. The matrix exercises the new QA tools as part of its exported-surface coverage.


## 2.0.51 — 400-action Test Automation + reusable Gutenberg fixture
- Test Automation session budget increased from 200 to 400 lifecycle actions.
- Gutenberg regression fixture is now reusable: an existing managed draft/private fixture is reset to baseline and reused; a new fixture is created only when none exists.
- On disable, expiry, or build change the managed fixture is kept as a draft and reset to baseline rather than deleted.
- Human approval remains the default outside an active scoped Test Automation session.

## 2.0.52 — Next-stage read foundations, 1000-action Test Automation and paginated operation ledger
- Test Automation session budget increased from 400 to 1000 lifecycle actions.
- wp-admin operation UI now has a dedicated action queue showing up to 50 pending/approved operations and a complete paginated ledger with 50 operations per page, so older operations remain accessible.
- Added `wp.rest_routes` and `wp.rest_read`: same-site registered GET-only REST discovery and bounded redacted reads. External URLs, traversal and sensitive/internal routes are blocked.
- Added privacy-safe WooCommerce deep reads: `woocommerce.get_variations` and `woocommerce.search_orders`; order results omit customer PII.
- Added `batch.preflight`: dependency graph validation/topological ordering for up to 100 steps without executing child operations.
- Regression Matrix covers the new read tools; Security Fuzz adds REST external/traversal/sensitive-route negative cases.

## 2.0.53 — Resumable Batch Executor, 100000-action Test Automation, REST user hardening
- Test Automation session budget increased from 1000 to 100000 lifecycle actions. TTL, administrator ownership, MCP-client binding, session tagging and fixture allowlists remain unchanged.
- Universal REST now blocks the complete `/wp/v2/users` route family. User reads must use the dedicated minimized `wp.list_users` surface; application-password and other sensitive routes remain blocked.
- Added real MCP pagination to `wp.list_operations`: `page`, `per_page` (1–100) and optional status filtering, while preserving the wp-admin 50-row action queue and 50-row paginated full ledger.
- Added the durable resumable batch foundation: `batch.create`, `batch.list`, `batch.status`, `batch.resume`, `batch.retry`, `batch.cancel`, `batch.rollback`.
- Batch dependency order is validated before persistence. Jobs retain up to 50 recent entries, up to 100 steps per job, a bounded 512 KiB input payload and bounded per-step result summaries.
- Read steps execute immediately in bounded chunks. Write steps never perform direct live writes: they create normal sandbox child operations and the batch pauses for the existing approval/apply lifecycle.
- A resumed batch reconciles child-operation status before continuing. Failed steps can be retried up to five times without duplicating an active child operation.
- Batch cancellation does not silently reject or apply child operations. Existing child operations remain visible in the normal operation ledger.
- Batch rollback reconciles applied child operations in reverse dependency order. Outside Test Automation it returns the exact operation IDs requiring wp-admin rollback confirmation; inside scoped Test Automation it may use only the existing session-tagged rollback exception.
- Regression Matrix covers the new batch job lifecycle and MCP operation pagination. Security Fuzz adds collection and single-user Universal REST blocks.
- Expected MCP catalog with Content Navigation enabled: 86 tools.

## 2.0.54 — Hardened Batch State Machine, Pause, Checkpoints, Receipts and Proof
- Preserves the 100000-action scoped Test Automation budget and all 2.0.53 REST privacy/pagination protections.
- Fixes the runtime-discovered batch retry edge case: `batch.retry` is blocked while any child operation in the job remains unresolved.
- Adds `batch.pause` to stop future scheduling without cancelling steps or mutating child operations.
- Adds optimistic batch `version` checks, bounded 60-second resume leases, checkpoint sequencing and up to 100 bounded job events.
- Adds `batch.dry_run` for executor support, dependency depth, payload sizing and expected sandbox pause-point estimates without creating a job.
- Adds `batch.receipt` and `batch.proof` for batch-level execution evidence and SHA-256 proof bound to site/install/build context.
- Existing safety remains unchanged: batch write steps create sandbox child operations only; direct live writes stay disabled and normal human approval remains the default.

## 2.0.55 — Batch child state reconciliation
- Batch status, list and receipt now read the current child-operation state and recalculate summaries without mutating stored checkpoints during reads. A cancelled batch whose child is later rejected reports that step as failed, with no stale waiting-approval count.
- Pause, retry, cancel and rollback persist reconciled child states in their next checkpoint. The strict retry Regression Matrix case checks rejection, current status/receipt, terminal-child retry and subsequent cancel.
- MCP catalog remains 90 tools and self-test remains 49 checks. The direct ChatGPT `batch.proof` routing issue was observed outside the plugin; server tool export and REST invocation are present.

## 2.0.56 — Atomic Batch Mutation Mutex
- Uses a database-scoped MySQL named lock around create, resume, pause, retry, cancel and rollback. A competing request receives 409 before reading or changing a job; an unavailable lock fails closed with 503. The 60-second lease remains as job checkpoint metadata.
- Adds a MySQL integration test with two independent PHP processes and CI for PHP 8.2–8.4 lint, ZIP integrity and mutex contention.
- The MCP catalog remains 90 tools; the self-test remains 49 checks.

## 2.0.57 — OAuth schema upgrade gate
- Runs the three OAuth `dbDelta` statements only when the OAuth schema version needs migration, rather than on every WordPress request. Verifies all tables before storing the version; an incomplete migration retries on the next request.
- The MySQL CI test checks retry after a missing table, subsequent request without `dbDelta`, and registered client retention.
- The MCP catalog remains 90 tools. Self-test expects 50 checks, including the OAuth schema version.

## 2.0.58 — Signed entitlement verifier foundation
- Adds a verification-only Ed25519 envelope for a future remote Control Plane. It checks exact signed bytes, pinned public key ID, site/installation/registration binding, short validity window, policy sequence, feature allowlist and quota shape.
- Includes cryptographic negative tests in PHP 8.2–8.4 CI. It does not fetch or activate a remote license, change existing local-owner access, or implement commercial quota reservations.
- MCP catalog remains 90 tools; self-test expects 51 checks.

## 2.0.59 — Elementor single source and in-place fragment edits
- Newly created Elementor drafts use `_elementor_data` as the only content source. The builder-generated `post_content` mirror is cleared and remains empty on future builder saves. A manual edit to `post_content` fails closed instead of being erased. Existing pages are not migrated automatically.
- `elementor.create_draft` accepts `source_post_id`. With no `data`, it clones the source Elementor tree, page template and allowlisted page layout metadata; supplied `data` remains authoritative while template/layout settings inherit. A front-page-only theme layout may still require visual adjustment on a different URL.
- `elementor.patch_fragment` replaces exactly one literal text/image/HTML fragment in an existing HTML widget, guarded by the widget SHA-256. It uses the usual sandbox approval/apply/rollback lifecycle.
- Regression Runner includes fragment patch/rollback and CI tests image/text edits, stale/ambiguous fragments, single-source saves and manual-content conflicts. Expected catalog: 91; self-test: 53.


## 2.0.61 — AI Lifecycle Control + Preview actions
- Adds an administrator-controlled **AI Lifecycle Control** switch. It is disabled by default.
- When enabled, the first authenticated administrator MCP client is bound to the mode and may call `operation.approve`, `operation.reject`, `operation.apply`, and `operation.rollback` for normal sandbox operations.
- Manual WP Admin controls remain available in parallel; enabling AI control does not remove or bypass human control.
- AI lifecycle calls still enter the same `OAI_REST::sandbox_action` path, preserving sandbox expiry, snapshot conflict detection, validation, Verify, receipts/proofs, and rollback conflict checks.
- The Okean AI Preview top bar now exposes status-aware manual controls for logged-in WordPress administrators: **Подтвердить / Отклонить / Применить / Откатить**.
- Preview actions use the authenticated WordPress session plus a REST nonce. A signed preview URL alone is not sufficient to mutate the site.
- Existing Test Automation Mode remains separate and unchanged for scoped regression fixtures.


## 2.0.62 — Runtime self-test + security status alignment
- `runtime.version` self-test now validates a semantic version plus a matching build-id prefix instead of hard-coding an older release number.
- `system.security_status` now exposes `ai_lifecycle_control` and guard flags for active AI lifecycle control, explicit opt-in, and preservation of manual lifecycle controls.
- Adds `security.ai_lifecycle_status_contract` to the read-only self-test suite.
- Expected MCP catalog: 91 tools. Expected self-test checks: 54.
- Direct live writes remain disabled. Human lifecycle remains the default; AI Lifecycle Control remains administrator opt-in and MCP-client-bound.

- `media.import_url_sandbox` — safe remote image import from public HTTP(S) URLs into the normal sandbox/apply/verify/rollback lifecycle (2.1.3 media URL import build).

2.1.6: Build-reset permissions are disabled before managed fixture cleanup. Cleanup is deferred until wp_loaded and listener exceptions are contained. Added failing-baseline upgrade regression and real WordPress/WooCommerce/Elementor/Yoast bootstrap CI. The reported production fatal error remains unconfirmed without its PHP stack trace.

2.1.7: Option snapshots use native top-level scalar storage strings while preserving nested array types. Numeric sanitizers no longer reject safe baselines or produce false verify conflicts across requests. Real WordPress cross-request apply/rollback and conflict checks added. Regression aliases preserve SKIP when a fixture is outside the active test allowlist. Unsafe legacy option baselines remain blocked.

2.1.8: Yoast option maps may change insertion order when logo caches are rebuilt. Option comparisons now ignore map insertion order while preserving every key, value, nested type and list order. Real Yoast normalization, no-op, apply/verify/rollback, cold-request verification and dropped-legacy-field protection are covered by WordPress CI.
